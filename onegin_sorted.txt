And do not make a step aside!
And think: Oh gosh, when will you die
But after falling gravely ill
But North is not for me, they say*.
But what a boredom is the session:
By Zeus’s supreme will elected
Eugene Onegin, my good fellow,
Here is my novel in verse hero,
Is craving homage, and has found
It is for others a good lesson,
It’s where I also used to play,
It was what a young rake expected,
Let me acquaint you with the one:
My uncle used to be so sound,
Or where you used to shine and revel.
That could not make a better deal.
The friends of “Ruslan and Lyudmila”!
The only heir of all his kin.
To entertain a half deceased,
To feign compassion, dose the drugs,
To set and fluff the pillows, thus,
To show fake sympathy, then, sigh
To watch a sick man day and night
Was born on Neva’s even shores,
What mean deceitfulness it is:
When dusting post-chaise speeded him,
Which, probably, were home of yours,
With no preface and just right now
